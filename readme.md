# Mytory Code View

This is WordPress plugin. 

On narrow screen, you can see only a part of code in `pre` tag. So swipe code. This is hell.

I tried line breaking. But line breaked code is hell, too.

So I decided to send code to new window. New window has wide viewport, syntax highlighting. 

This plugin add "open new window for this code" link to above of all `pre` block.
